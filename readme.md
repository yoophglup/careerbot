-   **A: EXPLANATION OF CHATBOT FUNCTIONALITIES**
    -   The user can use the chat bot to be offered a suggestion on a career. The bot will ask a series of questions. Based on the answers to those questions the bot will make a one out of five possible suggestions. The bot is not capable of any other conversation and any attempt will result in the bot stating “I am not sure what you are saying. Please type hello to start.” Once the user types ‘hello’, the bot will ask the user for their name. The bot will then proceed to ask four support questions.

    -   The chatbot is designed to operate inside the pandorabots.com website. The AIML code is compliant with AIML 2.0 and should be valid for any AIML chatbot enabled environment. The code is untested in any other environment currently.
    -   The questions and career types are entered in under the system properties file.
-   **G: MONITORING AND MAINTAINING**
    -   The application is not self-improving and should not need to be maintained. It could be upgraded to include basic chat features. As of now the AI will respond based on the yes or no response to four questions, but it could be improved to gather this information without directly asking the user. It could ask the user other questions and attempt to gain the required information indirectly.
